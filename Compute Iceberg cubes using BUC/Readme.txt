Hello,

Once the zip file containing my program files is unzipped and you are present in the given directory, the program can be run using command line : 

python3 BUC.py

You will then be prompted to enter an integer for minimum support value for Iceberg cube

Once this program is run a file named Iceberg-Cube-Results.txt fill be created. It will contain three requested cuboids

Thank You
